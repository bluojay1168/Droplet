# Drop
Hello, and welcome to our DubHacks 2021 project! 

## Project Objective
We hope that through visiting our website, users will be able to gain an understanding of the inequality in education (and more to come!) through interactive information pages and simulation games. Additionally, because every drop counts, users have a forum through which they can communicate their experiences through the game and throughout their real life, providing many perspectives on problems, issues, and solutions which reside in society.
